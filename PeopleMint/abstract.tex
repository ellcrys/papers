\abstract{
In this paper, We discuss a protocol that allows network participants receive the native currency of a blockchain in exchange of real-world national banknotes and also leverage on this activity to increase the security of the network via an observer-based, chain monitoring mechanism. This system is meant to be used as a mining protocol of the Ellcrys Network and offers a fairer and inclusive miner community where users who possess specialised hardware and those who are not privileged enough to afford them can both benefit.
